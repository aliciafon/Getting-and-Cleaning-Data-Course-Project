# Code Book
This file serves as the code book for tidy data set.
  
### Variable description

* The following variables were obtained from the downloaded files provided in the Coursera Assignment:
`x_test`, `y_test`,`x_train`, `y_train`, `subject_train`, `subject_test` 
* The following variables merged the above variables to continue further analysis: `x_data` & `y_data` 
* The appropriate names for the `x_data` dataset are contained within `features` which are applied to the column titles.

### About Data & Transformations Performed on Data Set

1. The dataset was downloaded and unzipped
2. Its existence was verified.
3. All data frames were assigned.
4. The R script was allowed to merge the training and the test sets into one data set.
5. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement was extracted.
6. The activities in the data set were named with descriptive activty names.
7. The data set was properly labeled with descriptive variable names.
8. A second tidy data set was produced separatly from the data set in the previous step. 
9. In the newly created data set was the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
